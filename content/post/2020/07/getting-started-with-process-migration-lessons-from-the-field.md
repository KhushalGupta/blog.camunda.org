Feel so entrenched in a monolithic system that you couldn't possibly migrate to a modern architecture? Hear from experts from Fidelity and Doculabs and gain confidence in your plans.

The global financial service industry hums at a pace of trillions of transactions each day, powered in large measure by BPM solutions and automation. Yet the industry remains fertile ground for transformation, with opportunities to offer better services and reducing costs.

At Fidelity Investments, a team responsible for process solutions is leaning in on opportunities to make greater use of AI and open source software to power workflows and transactions. The company has long been an technology innovator, modernizing technology applications throughout its history to gain an edge on the competition. Still many of its underlying processes are decades old and now under the microscope.

Doculabs Co-founder James Watson recently framed the common challenge that Fidelity and many financial services firms face as they look to move to next-generation architectures. He said, “They have built a process platform for (about 30,000) users: 10,000 in the branches or investor center, 10,000 on the phone, and 10,000 in the back office. These systems grew and evolved, and now they seem to be overly fragile and monolithic. Our clients are looking to be more agile, move faster, and work in the cloud.”

## Planning for Process Automation

It’s an all-too familiar scenario in the world of IT, Watson noted, not unlike the challenges of updating stalwart ERP systems. So how should firms set a plan to move to modern architectures, when so much legacy is built on existing systems? At [CamundaCon Live](https://www.camundacon.com/live/) earlier this year, Watson and Fidelity’s Fareed Saeed shared lessons they’ve learned from recent implementations to an audience of process automation professionals. Saeed’s team, in collaboration with Doculabs, is delivering a new digital process automation platform employing Camunda.

“We needed to come up with a way that we understood what the overall inventory of business processes in the firm, that we would want to move into the new platform but also have some references where we had some examples that we could size up the various different types of workflows,” said Fareed Saeed, head of product and tools for Advanced Product Solutions at Fidelity.

## Optimize for early impact when migrating to a new process automation platform

Doculabs’ Watson recommends identifying the processes within an organization that will deliver clear and obvious results, when updated and brought to modem platforms. Prioritize the highest volume processes first, keeping to a list of 50 or less, and rebuilding them from scratch to a new architecture.

“Most often these are processes that have been re-engineered a couple of times over, so there are people who understand them thoroughly, and you can begin to build on top of that understanding,” Watson said.  

Next, do the harder work of identifying processes that are dormant or rarely used, and retire them. Watson noted that some firms may find thousands of legacy processes that aren’t commonly used and may lighten the workload of a modernization project.

“Segment off those flows and those processes that have little or no volume; they are essentially dormant except for a few test cases or odd ball cases,” Watson said. “More often than not, these are processes that got built years ago and never got retired, because that’s not so easy to do in older process automation tools.”

What remains will likely be processes that are frequently used but not at significant volume; this portion will represent the “long tail” of the project. Use the experience and the momentum gained in the early phase of the project to gain support and traction as the work continues.

## Automation Leads to Business Innovation

Successful migration projects have to have clear alignment to business priorities, Saeed said. It’s important to understand the priorities of stakeholders in various business units, as it may impact timing and delivery on a project plan as well.

“We certainly have a business case to stand up the business structure and overall platform, and that was a part of the modernization effort that we are going through, Saeed said, noting that agile platforms can help organizations better adapt to better serve customers. “It isn’t simply about getting a cooler, better functioning platform. It is about the benefits of automation, the benefits of streamlining business processes.”

Watson added that ensuring there are basic capabilities in place to help business units leverage APIs and automation through RPA can be invaluable, noting, “Availing the line-of-business, record-keeping system stewards to take advantage of advanced process automation capabilities will make you quite popular with those teams because their hands have been tied for many years.”

## Taking the Factory Approach to a Migration

Many migration projects may take a factory approach to process automation, to understand and scope what work will be needed to deliver successful outcomes. As existing processes are inventoried and prioritized, Watson said they may fall into one of three definitions:

* ___Re-create and re-engineer___ when a process is broken and the underlying technology is inadequate.
* ___Re-use and standardize___ when a process works, but the technology is inadequate.
* ___Migrate “as-is”___ and integrate when both the process and technology work as desired.

Saeed noted such a factory model can help organizations dissect their current state, prioritize their workflows and move them onto a new environment. He noted, however, that he expects stakeholders will want to take advantage of any opportunity to optimize their processes that a migration may offer, which may add cycles to a factory model. “My gut feeling is, as we get into it, we are going to see more and more of our business partners wanting to re-engineer and modify those workflows before putting them into the new environment,” he said. Watson agreed, adding that in cases where a process is working and technology may be dated, then a factory approach can help by taking advantage of componentry reuse and common standards for greater efficiency.

“As business owners see an opportunity to recreate a process in a new tool, they’ll also oftentimes take the opportunity to improve the process or re-engineer it. That adds time and cost, but the outcomes tend to be better,” Watson said.

## Governance is a Driver for Process Migration

Improving standards and governance across an organization can be a business driver for automation projects. Saeed said that business leaders can partner with process automation teams to find common reusable processes as well, whether it is the way we communicate with our customers or the way we do quality assurance, there might be some opportunities for reuse as well.

“I am really excited, because I think there is a growing interest in exploring some of those common business processes which allow us to bring more re-use from an enterprise perspective,” Saeed said, noting that any governance project should reflect common taxonomy and data approaches.

Watson noted its common for business unit to see what makes them unique rather than discover opportunities for synergy. Helping them understand how process models can be reused will help drive a project’s success.

“If you can get them to buy in and understand those common elements, it saves you a lot of time and energy in the development, deployment and of course the maintenance cost,” he said.

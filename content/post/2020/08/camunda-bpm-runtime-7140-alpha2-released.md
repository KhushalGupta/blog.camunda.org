## Feature 1

## All New Frontend Plugin System for Cockpit

We are happy to announce an all new frontend plugin system for Cockpit. The new plugin system allows you to use the Javascript framework you are most familiar with, whether it be React, Angular, or just plain JavaScript.

You can learn all about it in the [separate blogpost](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2020/08/cockpit-7.14-plugin-system-introduction/) where we walk you through the development of a plugin that uses React.

## Additional Supported Environments

Camunda BPM 7.14.0-alpha2 adds support for Microsoft SQL Server 2019. 

You can read more about that on the [supported environments](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/introduction/supported-environments/) documentation page.

## Support for Spring Boot 2.3

The Spring Boot version in the Camunda Spring Boot Starter has been upgraded to version 2.3.1. 
This allows to use the latest features of Spring Boot together with the Starter, e.g. using it together with Java 14.

You can check out the [Spring Boot Release Notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes) 
and our [Spring Boot Starter documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/) for further insights.
